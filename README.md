# Report Intermittent Fails

Open Github Issues for intermittently failing tests.  Inspired by [GoCardless](https://gocardless.com/blog/track-flaky-specs-automatically/)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tansaku/report_intermittent_fails.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tansaku/report_intermittent_fails)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'report_intermittent_fails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install report_intermittent_fails

## Usage

:construction: UNDER CONSTRUCTION :construction:

Relying on spec_helper.rb setting:

```
  config.example_status_persistence_file_path = "spec/examples.txt"
```

and env settings specific to the project you want to check intermittent fails on like so (will usually be need to set on CI)

```
REPO_NAME_WITH_OWNER=AgileVentures/LocalSupport
GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=<token>
MAIN_BRANCH=develop
```

NOTE: do we need list of branches we can open new issues for?

From the command line tasks can be run like so, but really they are intended to be run as part of a CI build

```
$ bundle exec dotenv rake report_intermittent_fails:rerun_failing_tests

```

to run in CI the gem needs to be added to the project you want to monitor and the tasks run from the CI script, e.g. in .travis.yml

```
- bundle exec rake report_intermittent_fails:reassemble_spec_examples
- bundle exec rake report_intermittent_fails:rerun_failing_tests
```

even if you are not breaking the tests up to run in parallel `reassemble_spec_examples` is currently needed to put the test results in the correct file for processing by `rerun_failing_tests`

## TODO

* [ ] usage instructions
* [ ] consistent approach for env vars
* [x] more tests 
* [x] gemification
* [x] remove all puts and place with logger ...
* [ ] are there existing test reassembling tools that would be more reliable for us to use?
* [ ] review the rubocop disables we've put in

## Approach

So we have a couple of well tested objects to create issues and to analyze rspec logs.  There are a few places where we are running on the metal via backticks.

Everything is under tests, but we could probably use another object in the rerun_failing_tests file, and some general review and reorganisation there as it's just been split up to meet the rubocop requirements rather than been made to appear coherent ...

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
